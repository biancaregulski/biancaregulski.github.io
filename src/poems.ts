        "text": "From an outside angle, \nWithin nature's tangle,\nA bustling downpour, a spattering bawl.\nBut the sight from inside —\nThe room where I reside —\nA window view of a hushed waterfall.\n\nDown a smooth square of glass,\nI watch the droplets pass —\nPale crystals descend from upper reaches.\nIn the speckled design,\nThere two driblets combine —\nTumbling on until the sunlight breaches."

      "title": "The Course of Discovery",
      "text": "With steps at a devoted pace\nToward an undiscovered place\nWith shaded twists the land is fraught—\nHere where value shall be sought.\n\nFor what is left on plain display\nIn obvious and clear array\nMay have been found by now per chance\nBy one who passed and gave it glance.\n\nWhile what is waiting underhill\nInviting those of lively will\nRequires a more fervent task\nOf steady searching to unmask.\n\nThough what has just been found by one\nWhich not before had seen the Sun—\nA suited place it ought to find\nBut when harmonically aligned."

    title: 'Portrait of Rain',
    text: "From an outside angle, \nWithin nature's tangle,\nA bustling downpour, a spattering bawl.\nBut the sight from inside —\nThe room where I reside —\nA window view of a hushed waterfall.\n\nDown a smooth square of glass,\nI watch the droplets pass —\nPale crystals descend from upper reaches.\nIn the speckled design,\nThere two driblets combine —\nTumbling on until the sunlight breaches."

    title: 'The Course of Discovery',
    text: 'With steps at a devoted pace\nToward an undiscovered place\nWith shaded twists the land is fraught—\nHere where value shall be sought.\n\nFor what is left on plain display\nIn obvious and clear array\nMay have been found by now per chance\nBy one who passed and gave it glance.\n\nWhile what is waiting underhill\nInviting those of lively will\nRequires a more fervent task\nOf steady searching to unmask.\n\nThough what has just been found by one\nWhich not before had seen the Sun—\nA suited place it ought to find\nBut when harmonically aligned.'

    title: 'Yellow Afternoon',
    text: "A glow follows the sunset's western stride,\nThis yellow afternoon as daytime slows.\nAn amber hue that paints a small space wide\nEmerges, guiding where attention goes.\n\nUnfocused eyes are sharpened by these rays\nThat pour out an elucidating sheen.\nI watch the sky transition from a haze\nInto an intricate, evolving scene.\n\nThe sun's descent brings senses to full height,\nThis yellow afternoon where presence grows.\nAs background became foreground in my sight,\nDirection fell as observation rose.\n\nAs time turns like the spinning of a spoon,\nI watch the passing yellow afternoon."
